### Hi, I'm Mac 👋

I'm an MSc Cybersecurity & AI student at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs). I'm highly interested in Cybersecurity, Machine Learning, Mathematical and Agent-Based modelling, and Formal Logic.

I also did my Undergraduate BSc Computer Science with a Year in Industry at Sheffield. For my [Undergraduate Dissertation](https://github.com/Twigonometry/IsabelleDSL) I researched ways to generate Domain-Specific Languages with Isabelle.

I've just finished a summer placement at BT doing threat modelling, and have my Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) and AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certifications. I love to create educational resources and challenges in Cybersecurity, and help to run the [Sheffield Ethical Student Hackers](https://shefesh.com) society in my spare time.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on assignments including Embedded Systems security, Language Models with Embeddings, and [scalable machine learning](https://github.com/Twigonometry/ScalableML) with PySpark; as well as a dissertation using [Adversarial Learning to Detect and Generate Phishing Emails](https://github.com/Twigonometry/Phishing-ML)
- ⌨️ I like to program in Python, C, Haskell, and PHP
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about malware, making CTF challenges, and keeping up my data science and cloud skills
- 🎓 I will be graduating in October 2023
