### Hi, I'm Mac ðŸ‘‹

I'm an MComp Computer Science student at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs). I'm highly interested in Cybersecurity, Mathematical and Agent-Based modelling, Machine Learning, and Formal Logic. I'm currently researching ways to generate Domain-Specific Languages with Isabelle for my [Dissertation project](https://github.com/Twigonometry/IsabelleDSL).

I've just finished a Year in Industry placement in public-sector Cybersecurity, and recently gained my Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification. I love to create educational resources and challenges in Cybersecurity, and help to run the [Sheffield Ethical Student Hackers](https://shefesh.com) society in my spare time.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on writing lots of (deliberately) vulnerable code for hacking challenges, but will be restarting university projects soon!
- ðŸ’¬ I like to program in Python, C, Haskell, and PHP
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about malware, making CTF challenges, and mathematical modelling

Feel free to contact me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mac__goodwin), or take a look at [my site](https://www.mac-goodwin.com/) for more information about my various projects.
